Package of the kinematic fitting tool KinFitter

How the package can be used is more precisely described in the thesis "Kinematic fits in ttbar resonance searches" by Melanie Eich. 
Furthermore all different issues like parametrisation and so on are described there.

An example of using the tool in an analysis can be found in the low mass ttbar resonance search.
